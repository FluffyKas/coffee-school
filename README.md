Coffee School Website (single page)

This website is the first project for my portfolio. My aim here was to work from absolutely nothing and create a simple but responsive and functioning website. 
It was my first ever attempt at creating something from nothing and frankly, it has proved to be quite a challenge. :)
I learned a bunch of things along the way and thorougly enjoyed the process.

## My process

I used Figma's awesome whiteboard tool, FigJam to gather my ideas in one place. I gathered all colours and images I wanted to use and designed the basic layout.
I started out with a basic HTML markup, then moved on to research and implement Bootstrap classes. I used Bootstrap's CDN. Considering the small scale of the project,
this seemed to be the most sensible choice to me, even though I ended up customising it a lot through vanilla CSS.
I added a map for the location with the help of mapbox.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap 5.0
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Figma's FigJam
- VSCode


### What I learned

I learned to appreciate when I'm given a design and I only need to worry about my code! :)) 
I've got to practice every step of the process of building a website which I found extremely challenging but also very enjoyable.
This was also my first attempt at using FigJam for gathering my ideas and using Bootstrap and I'd like to believe I've gained a level of confidence in using both tools. :)
It was the first time also to use an API (mapbox).
